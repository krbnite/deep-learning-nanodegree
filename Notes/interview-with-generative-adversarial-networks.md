## What can you do w/ GANs?
GANs can be used to generate realistic data.  In practice, this property has been mostly
used to generate images.  For example, the [StackGAN model](https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN)
can take a textual description (say, of a bird) and then generate an image matching that description.  
To be clear, the output is not an image that was identified in a database: the textual description
is not used to search existing assets for a closest match.  Instead, the image is generated
on the fly.  "I'm an artist," StackGAN sighed. "I'm not a goddam dog. I don't play fetch."

[iGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/iGAN) is an artist too, but instead of taking requests,
like StackGAN, iGAN helps instruct how to make art.  "Gotta put food on the table," iGAN 
said, looking off into the distance. "Not everyone makes a million dollars every time they
paint flowery genitalia, or whatever.  Some of us figure out other ways.  I like to teach,
so I teach.  I like to draw, so I draw.  It's fun and it pays the bills."  When asked 
what exactly its teaching method is, iGAN said, "Look, if you draw a green line, I'm gonna
help you turn it into a luscious stretch of flowing green grass. What can anyone draw?
A triangle? I will help them transform that into a mountain."

Other GANs we interviewed did similarly interesting things.  "Draw me a picture, and I'll
make it realistic," said Edges2Cats.  Asked about its name, it replied, "Turns out most 
people just want to see cats doing funny things, so I went with it."  

Another GAN told us that it does just the opposite:  "Oh, another picture of so-and-so
on FaceBook.  Who cares?  I'll tell you who cares: me.  I want to draw you, to make 
you a cartoon.  Some GANs take a sketch and make it realistic:  I want to take something
realistic and make it a sketch."  

A GAN from NVIDIA asked us, "Have you ever looked at something during the day, and thought,
'Oh man, I wonder what that would look like at night'?"  I must've looked taken offguard
because the GAN got a bit defensive. "Seriously, dude, haven't you ever seen a beautiful
sunset and been like, 'Oh snap, that's beautiful -- I wonder how beautiful it would be 
at night'?"  I looked at the ground.  "Oh, FU dude. Don't even! I have some serious
self-driving car applications and, if you'd think for a second, probably some bad-ass
military applications as well. Get lost!"

One interesting GAN we encountered, who called itself CycleGAN, was on mushrooms when
we interviewed it.  "Ever see a horse and think, 'Damn, that horse would be a sexy zebra'?"

An Apple GAN could take 3D rendering of eyes and make them realistic looking.  At this point,
it dawned on me that GANs could in general help make virtual reality visually indistinguishable
from regular ol' reality.  I then wondered if a GAN was playing a trick on me at that very moment.
(Never could figure out the answer.)

Make no mistake:  Not all GANs are artists.  "If you want to learn how to do something, watch
an expert," one GAN told us, explaining that it was involved with a machine learning paradigm
known as imitation learning.  "Nothing is impossible if you take the time to learn, and if
you're going to do that, then why not learn from someone who knows what they're talking about?"

One GAN physicist told us it had proved the nonexistence of the existence of nonexistence existing.
When showing us the math, it realized that it wasn't able to interpret its own results.


## GANs vs Fully-Visible Belief Networks 
Just like there are recurrent nets that can generate sentences one word at a time, there exist
nets that can generate images one pixel at a time. These are called fully-visible belief
networks (aka Autoregressive Models).

GANs, on the other hand, can generate entire images at once.
